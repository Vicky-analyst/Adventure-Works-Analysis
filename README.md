# Adventure-Works-Analysis
This project explores the factors driving the strong sales of bikes, focusing on both product performance and external influences. The bike category has seen consistent success, with several contributing factors such as customer demographics, weather conditions, and urban commuting trends. Customers with higher disposable incomes, like those with bachelorâ€™s degrees and professional occupations, are more likely to invest in bikes, but weather patterns also play a significant role in demand. Seasonal changes, such as warmer months, lead to increased sales, while adverse weather may impact purchase decisions. Additionally, the growing emphasis on health, fitness, and eco-friendly transportation options has made bikes an attractive choice for many. The project aims to analyze these diverse factors and recommend strategies to optimize product offerings and marketing efforts.
